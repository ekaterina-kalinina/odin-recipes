    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Margherita Pizza is the Italian classic. It features a simple but tasty combination of red tomato sauce, white mozzarella cheese, and green basil. The secret to its perfection lies in using fresh, high-quality ingredients and a very hot oven to achieve a thin, crispy crust.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>500 grams of flour</li>
      <li>325 milliliters of water</li>
      <li>7 grams of dry active yeast</li>
      <li>5 grams of white sugar</li>
      <li>10 grams of salt</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>400 grams of canned peeled tomatoes</li>
      <li>250 grams of mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>10-15 fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small bowl, mix the warm water, sugar, and yeast together. Let it sit for 10 minutes until it looks foamy on top.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir with a spoon until a dough forms, then knead it with your hands for 8 to 10 minutes until it is smooth and stretchy.</li>
      <li>Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover it with a cloth, and leave it in a warm place for about 1 to 2 hours until it has doubled in size.</li>
      <li>Turn your oven to 220°C. Place your baking tray inside while the oven heats up.</li>
      <li>While the oven heats, crush the canned tomatoes in a bowl with a fork or blender and add a pinch of salt.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into two balls. On a floured surface, stretch or roll each ball into a thin circle about 25 to 30 centimeters wide.</li>
      <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Arrange the mozzarella slices evenly on top.</li>
      <li>Carefully place the pizza on the hot baking tray in the oven. Bake for 8 to 12 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling.</li> 
      <li>Take the pizza out and immediately top it with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve hot.</li>
